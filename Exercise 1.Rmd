#Analyze. Share. Reproduce. 
##and do it all 
###with R Markdown. 
Your data tells a story. Tell it with `R` Markdown. Turn your analyses into **high quality** documents, reports, presentations and dashboards - and don't forget to drink some $\sf{H_{2}0}$ while you do that.[^1] 

R Markdown documents are fully reproducible. Use a [productive notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html)[^2] interface to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output. Use multiple languages including 

* R
* Python

and

* SQL

>Do you need still need convincing to use R Markdown? See what a friend once said: I used to use Sweave, and get terrible headaches. Now I use R Markdown, and life is much more pleasant.
